# Matrix Calculator

## Description
The Matrix Calculator is a Java Swing-based application designed to perform various matrix operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for computing determinants, performing Gauss-Jordan elimination, calculating transposes, inverses, and powers of matrices, as well as for matrix multiplication, addition, and subtraction. The application allows customization of matrix dimensions and includes features for clearing matrices or filling them with zeros or random numbers.

## Features
- **Matrix Operations**: Supports determinant calculation, Gauss-Jordan elimination, transpose, inverse, power, multiplication, addition, and subtraction of matrices.
- **Customizable Matrix Dimensions**: Allows users to set the dimensions of the matrices for the calculations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface created with Java Swing, providing buttons for various operations and input fields for matrix entries.
- **Additional Utilities**: Includes options to clear matrices, fill matrices with zeros, or generate random numbers for matrix entries.

## How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java and Java Swing installed on your machine.
2. **Download and Compile**: Download the `.java` files and compile them using a Java compiler.
3. **Execute the Main Class**: Run the `MainFrame` class to start the application.

## Usage
1. Start the application by running the `MainFrame` class.
2. Select the desired matrix operation from the available buttons.
3. Enter the dimensions for the matrix (or matrices) involved in the operation.
4. Input the matrix elements or use the utility buttons to fill the matrices.
5. Click on the operation button (e.g., 'Determinant', 'Multiply') to perform the calculation and view the result.

## Components
- **MainFrame**: The main class that initiates the application and presents the operation options.
- **DetCalc**: Handles the determinant calculation of a matrix.
- **TwoMatrixFrame**: Manages operations involving two matrices such as Gauss-Jordan, Transpose, Inverse, Power.
- **ThreeMatrixFrame**: Facilitates operations involving three matrices such as Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
